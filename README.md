# Implementation of the Algorithms and Data Structures

### Sorting Algorithms

- Insertion Sort (in-place)
- Bubble Sort (in-place)
- Selection Sort (in-place)
- Merge Sort
- Fast Merge Sort (using insertion sort when it's faster than merge in a specific chunk size)
- Heapsort 

### Search Algorithms

- Linear Search


### Data Structures

- Max/Min Heap
